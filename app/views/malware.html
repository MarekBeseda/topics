<p>The term malware (or malicious software) covers any software which can cause an unwanted impact on systems. Malware exploits defects in software in order to extract data or to cause harm to the system itself. The risk of introducing malware to a system, or spreading it is contained within every information exchange / transfer. Accordingly, protection against malware is a crucial part of security for any ICS.</p>

<p>ICS have been target of a lot of malicious malware in the last decade, the most prevalent of which was Stuxnet. There’s however a range of different tools such as <a href='equationCaseStudy'>GreyFish & Flame</a>, BlackEnergy, Haves, and Duqu.</p>


<br>
<h4 id="malware-enisa">ENISA</h4>
<p>
Once again, ENISA lists malware as one of the top threats in their annual threat landscape. It states that there are over 600 million new samples of malware discovered per quarter.
</p>

<br>
<h4 id="malware-types">Common Types of Malware</h4>
<p>These are the most common types of malware according to the 2016 threat landscape:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Trojans</b> – this type of malware makes up around 60% of malware which is currently in circulation. Trojans are a form of software which transports malware into the infected system. The most common payload are backdoors.

Trojans have been targeting Industrial Control Systems such as SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems. They are generally based on drive-by downloads of human-machine interfaces that poses then tricks the user to download malicious software.
</li>

<li><b>Viruses</b> – programs which are capable of replicating themselves and spreading onto multiple machines, performing certain malicious actions.

ICS virus attacks seem to have spiked in late 2015, when more attackers felt that ICS are too insecure. The viruses have delivered through Trojans disguising themselves as patches and updates to used software from Siemens, GE, and Advantech to make users download them.
</li>

<li><b>Worms</b> – similar to viruses, this type of malware always causes at least some harm to systems, even if it only shows as consumption of bandwidth.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Groups such as Grizzly Steppe have been using these and more programs to infiltrate ICS and other networks as shown on the infographic below.</p>

<h4 id="malware-risk">The Risks</h4>
<p>As malware may cause disruption of services, physical and reputational damage and also breach of importation contracts/duties, it is of utmost importance to protect against them accordingly. The most common vectors of introduction of malware are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Email</b> - As email is still the most used form of communication within an organisation, adversaries usually target employees with directed spearphishing attacks tailored towards the ICS. ENISA’s threat landscape states that e-mails are the number one malware introduction channel. As usual, it strongly stresses that many of these attacks are avoidable with correct user education.</li>

<li><b>The Web</b> - Adversaries may replicate websites which an organisation uses regularly in order to get access to employees’ login credentials. These websites are usually distributed with links from phishing e-mails. Another attack vector are websites injected with malicious code.</li>

<li><a href='removable'>Removable Media</a> - With most organisations still using removable media as their main means of transporting information, it is common that adversaries target this form of media to introduce malware into systems.</li>

<li><b>Personal Devices and Mobile Malware</b> - As many employees use personal devices (Laptops, Smartphones) to access work e-mail accounts, malware protection is especially important for these devices. ENISA’s threat landscape states that mobile malware has risen by 150% for 2016. Furthermore, mobile malware has grown both in numbers and also in sophistication. The most notable growth lies in mobile ransomware, whose numbers quadrupled in 2016.</li>

<li><b>Application Whitelisting</b> - Many attacks seem to reuse very similar software and can be blacklisted as such entirely. Modern anti-virus programs should be able to deal with the majority of such cases. Still, only software from whitelisted known companies/origin should be allowed to run on ICS due to their critical importance.</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="malware-recomendations">Recommendations</h4>
<p>
Develop ICS-specific anti-malware policies. Amongst others, this includes constantly patching software and maintaining user education and awareness with campaigns promoting the importance of awareness. Doing so can greatly decrease the risks towards security.
</p>
<p>
Scan all imported and exported data on a remote machine to avoid the introduction of malware into the ICS. Furthermore, all machines should be provided with appropriate malware protection.
Use available technologies to report and, moreover, prevent access to malicious websites.

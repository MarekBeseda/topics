<h2>User Education and Awareness</h2>
<br></br>

<p>As users play a critical role in their organisation’s security, the lack of user education is a great threat to their organisation’s security. This especially applies to industrial control systems (ICS) as they not only handle sensitive data, but also interact with the physical world, which,  in case of security breach, may cause harm to the organisation, its employees or the environment and also critical data leakage.</p>
<p>
  To battle this issue, every organisation should systematically deploy security-awareness programmes and hold regular training sessions amongst their employees to propagate a security-conscious work culture.
</p>

<p>There are many risks originating in bad user education. Some notable examples applicable to ICS are external attacks, infections based on removable media and insider threats.</p>

<p>Users are attackers’ primary target as they have access to various parts of the system and privileges associated with the system.</p>

<h4>A statement by ENISA</h4>

<p>As an example, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security’s (ENISA) Threat landscape for 2016, the number one threat, malware is mainly transported through e-mails with malware as an attachment and e-mails with malicious URL. ENISA directly stated in their report, that it is evident, that user training and awareness can significantly reduce malware infections.</p>

<h4>Phishing</h4>
<p>Phishing attacks have become more sophisticated in 2016, as they have successfully reached executive level, meaning phishing-based CEO fraud has happened, which has great impact on the security of the company. The report states that 12% of recipients of phishing mail have clicked the attached links and documents. Furthermore, the most common attachments in phishing e-mails were .doc files (40%). The .doc files contain macros which, when run, download malware to the affected computer in the background. According to Common cyber attacks: reducing  the impact, one phishing attack on a high-profile UK organisation pointed out poor user awareness, as a malicious file requested approval to run multiple times, until the user clicked ‘OK’.
</p>

<h4>Insider Threat</h4>
<p>Insider threat plays an important role in many attacks. Interestingly enough, 50 to 60% of insider threats were caused inadvertently. The necessity to minimise insider threats is motivated by the fact that insider breaches are amongst the most difficult to detect and to protect from. Interestingly, more than half of organisations do not monitor insider threat, which makes them much more vulnerable to attacks.
</p>
<p>Every ICS must have a user security policy. This policy must always be tailor-made for the system, as every system is different. It should mainly involve procedures, such as new staff induction to boost awareness of the responsibility they carry. Furthermore, all employees should undergo thorough training and validation of their security skills through recognised certifications. In many cases this may require specialist training. Awareness should also be propagated regularly. </p>
<p>

<h4>Recomendations</h4>
  <h6>The top 5 things organisations should do to increase user awareness and education:</h6>
  <ol>
    <li>Create their own security policy - as mentioned before, new staff induction, emergency responses</li>
    <li>Regular awareness meetings and talks - presentations about possible risks, adversaries’ proceedings and how to avoid them</li>
    <li>Organise specialist training for employees (like courses by ICS-SANS) - these trainings are mainly meant for managers and security staff, but there are specialised courses for users to enable them to directly communicate with security staff without language barriers</li>
    <li>Formally assess employees’ security skills - for example, send fake phishing e-mails. This will enable the organisation to see how effectively their users are enforcing security, and simultaneously will point out weak links in the security</li>
    <li>Promote an incident reporting culture - doing so will encourage users to report security concerns to security staff, which may aid earlier detection of possible breaches.</li>
  </ol>
